4. Setup & Local Development
This section provides a streamlined, step-by-step guide to set up and run the project locally using Docker. It incorporates all the critical lessons learned from prototyping, ensuring a smooth and repeatable development experience.

4.1. Prerequisites
Docker Desktop: Ensure the latest stable version is installed and running on your system.

Node.js & Yarn (Optional but Recommended): While most development occurs within Docker, having Node.js (v20+) and Yarn (v1 or v2+) installed globally can be helpful for initial project setup scripts or debugging.

VS Code Docker Extension (Highly Recommended): For a visual interface to manage containers, view logs, and debug, install the Docker extension for VS Code.

4.2. Docker Desktop Configuration
For optimal performance, especially on macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon):

Allocate Resources:

Open Docker Desktop Settings (⚙️ icon) > Resources.

Allocate sufficient CPUs (e.g., 4 cores) and Memory (e.g., 6GB+). Adjust based on your system's capabilities and project needs.

Configure File Sharing:

Go to Settings > Features in development (or General, depending on your Docker Desktop version) > File Sharing Implementation.

Select VirtioFS for significantly improved bind mount performance between your host machine and the Docker VM.

4.3. Initial Project Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone [your-repo-url] ecommerce-project
cd ecommerce-project

Create .env File:
Create your local .env file by copying the provided example. This file will store sensitive environment variables and is excluded from version control (.gitignore).

cp .env.example .env

Edit .env: Open the newly created .env file and verify/update the values for DATABASE_URL, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB, and NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL if necessary.

4.4. Build & Run Services with Docker Compose
All services are defined and orchestrated via the docker-compose.yml file, located in the docker/ directory. This configuration integrates critical optimizations and past lessons for reliable service startup.

Build Docker Images:
Run this command from the project root:

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build

This command builds the Docker images for the backend and frontend services and prepares the db (PostgreSQL) service.

Key Fixes Applied: The build.context and env_file paths within docker-compose.yml are correctly set relative to the docker-compose.yml file's location (e.g., ../backend for context, ../.env for the environment file). This resolves common "path not found" errors. Dockerfiles are named simply Dockerfile and are located directly within their respective service directories (backend/Dockerfile, frontend/Dockerfile).

Start Services:
Run this command from the project root:

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

This starts the db (PostgreSQL), backend (Node.js/Express), and frontend (Next.js) services in detached mode.

UID Argument: The docker-compose.yml passes your host's User ID (UID=${UID:-1000}) to the containers as a build argument, mitigating common file permission issues with bind mounts.

Named Volumes for node_modules: Named volumes (e.g., backend_node_modules, frontend_node_modules) are explicitly used for node_modules directories. This is critical for performance, ensuring dependencies are installed and managed efficiently within the Docker VM's faster filesystem, bypassing slow host-to-VM file synchronization.

delegated Mounts: Source code bind mounts (e.g., ./backend/src:/app/src:delegated) utilize delegated mode for optimal filesystem performance on macOS.

Healthchecks & depends_on: Services are configured to start in the correct order, with the backend waiting for the database to be fully healthy and accepting connections.

4.5. Initialize Database Schema (Prisma)
Once the db and backend containers are running, you need to apply your initial database schema using Prisma.

Run Prisma Migration:
Execute this command from the project root:

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec backend npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_schema

This command runs npx prisma migrate dev inside the backend container, connecting it to the db service to apply the schema defined in prisma/schema.prisma.

4.6. Verify Services
Verify Backend:
Open your web browser or a tool like Postman/Insomnia and navigate to: http://localhost:3001/health
You should receive a successful JSON response (e.g., {"message":"Backend is healthy and connected to DB!"}), confirming your Node.js/Express backend is running and accessible.

Verify Frontend:
Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000
You should see the "Welcome to the E-commerce Store!" page, indicating the Next.js frontend is running.

4.7. Stopping Services
To stop all running services:

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes (including persistent database data - use with caution):

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down -v

5. Code Guidelines & Best Practices
This template adheres to industry-standard practices for code quality, readability, and maintainability, crucial for collaborative and scalable projects.

Modularity: Code is organized into small, focused modules (e.g., controllers, services, components) with clear, single responsibilities.

Type Safety: TypeScript is consistently used across both frontend and backend to enhance code quality, reduce runtime errors, and improve developer experience.

Linting & Formatting: ESLint and Prettier are configured project-wide to enforce consistent code style and identify potential issues early in the development cycle.

Clear Naming: Variables, functions, and files are named descriptively and consistently, following established conventions.

Comments: Comments are used judiciously to explain complex logic, business rules, or non-obvious decisions, avoiding redundant "what" comments.

Error Handling: Robust error handling is implemented at API boundaries and critical logic paths to ensure application resilience.

Environment Variables: All sensitive configurations and environment-specific settings are managed via environment variables, never hardcoded into the codebase.

6. Development Workflow
Hot Reloading: Both the frontend (Next.js development server) and backend (Nodemon via yarn dev script) are configured for automatic code reloading during development, providing a seamless and efficient developer experience.

Containerized Development: All core services run within isolated Docker containers, ensuring consistency across different developer machines and preventing "it works on my machine" issues.

Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended): Integration of linters and formatters with pre-commit hooks (e.g., using Husky and lint-staged) is highly recommended to enforce code quality and style standards automatically before code is committed.

7. Future Considerations & Scalability
This template provides a strong, extensible foundation for future expansion and production deployment:

Microservices Architecture: The modular structure naturally facilitates breaking out services into independent microservices as the application grows, enabling independent scaling and deployment.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): The infra/ directory serves as a placeholder for tools like Kubernetes (k8s) and Terraform, enabling automated, repeatable, and scalable cloud infrastructure provisioning.

CI/CD Pipelines: The .github/workflows/ directory is ready for defining automated build, test, and deployment pipelines, ensuring continuous integration and continuous delivery.

Comprehensive Testing: Dedicated tests/ directories for unit, integration, and E2E tests ensure application reliability and stability at scale.

Observability: For production environments, integrating robust logging, monitoring, and tracing tools will be crucial for understanding application health and performance.

Secrets Management: For production deployments, consider dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., Docker Secrets, Kubernetes Secrets, cloud provider Key Management Services) for enhanced security.

Load Balancing & Reverse Proxy: For production, a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Caddy) and load balancing will be essential for distributing traffic and handling SSL termination.

8. Lessons Learned (From Prototyping Phase)
This template directly incorporates critical lessons learned from a previous prototyping phase, aiming to eliminate common setup frustrations and accelerate future development:

Precise Docker Build Context & Relative Paths:

Problem: Ambiguous build.context and COPY command paths within Dockerfiles frequently led to "file not found" errors during Docker builds, especially in monorepos.

Solution: The docker-compose.yml now explicitly defines build.context relative to its own location (e.g., ../backend), and Dockerfiles are named simply Dockerfile within their respective service directories. COPY commands inside Dockerfiles are then correctly relative to their immediate build context.

Robust TypeScript Compilation Setup:

Problem: TypeScript compilation (tsc) often failed within Docker due to misconfigured tsconfig.json (e.g., commented-out outDir, missing include paths) or incorrect tsc invocation.

Solution: tsconfig.json files are rigorously configured with explicit rootDir, outDir, and include paths. The yarn build script in package.json is standard and reliable, ensuring successful compilation within the container.

Strict Dockerfile Syntax & Debugging:

Problem: Invalid Dockerfile syntax (e.g., inline comments with trailing slashes) caused silent parsing errors and build failures.

Solution: Strict adherence to Dockerfile syntax (comments on separate lines, no inline comments with trailing slashes) is enforced. The template is designed for clear build logs, facilitating quicker debugging.

node_modules Volume Management:

Problem: Slow bind mounts of node_modules from macOS hosts to Docker VMs caused significant performance degradation during development.

Solution: Named volumes are explicitly used for node_modules in docker-compose.yml, ensuring dependencies are installed and managed efficiently within the Docker VM's faster filesystem.

Centralized Environment Variables:

Problem: Scattered or missing .env files led to environment variable resolution issues across services.

Solution: A single .env.example at the project root, loaded via env_file: ../.env in docker-compose.yml, provides a clear and consistent approach to managing environment variables across all services.

This template stands as a testament to the value of iterative development and learning from challenges, providing a solid, repeatable foundation for any professional e-commerce project.
